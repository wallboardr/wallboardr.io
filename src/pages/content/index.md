Looking for an easy to use and highly configurable information radiator? Then Wallboardr might be for you.

At this point, Wallboardr is in early Alpha and is still building up functionality to be properly released. The plan is to make it available as a hosted service here. In the meantime the code is [available on Bitbucket][repo] if you are interested in running your own copy. Update to the `release` bookmark if you want something that is somewhat stable.

If you have any feedback/requests, you can go to [use the issue tracker](/request).

Work is tracked on [Trello][bl].
