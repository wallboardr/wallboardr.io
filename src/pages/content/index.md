Looking for an easy to use and highly configurable information radiator? Then Wallboardr might be for you.

Wallboardr lets you define a set of boards which contain screens of information that are displayed in a rotating cycle. Out of the box you can define textual messages, but through a series of plugins, you can hook into external systems to display whatever you want.

## Notice

At this point, Wallboardr is still in development and is still building up functionality to be properly released. In the meantime the code is [available on Bitbucket][repo] if you are interested in cloning and running your own copy. Update to the `stable` bookmark if you want something that is somewhat stable. The system should be quite usable, but certain things may still be a bit manual and undocumented, so I'm not prepared to say people should use it.

If you have any feedback/requests, you can go to [use the issue tracker](/request).

Work is tracked on [Trello][bl]. You can see what ideas and plans are in the making.
